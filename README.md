# TNO MPC Lab - Encryption Schemes - Utils

The TNO MPC lab consists of generic software components, procedures, and functionalities developed and maintained on a regular basis to facilitate and aid in the development of MPC solutions. The lab is a cross-project initiative allowing us to integrate and reuse previously developed MPC functionalities to boost the development of new protocols and solutions.

The package tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.utils is part of the TNO Python Toolbox.
