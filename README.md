# TNO PET Lab - secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) - Encryption Schemes - Utils

Useful functionality for implementing encryption schemes.

### PET Lab

The TNO PET Lab consists of generic software components, procedures, and functionalities developed and maintained on a regular basis to facilitate and aid in the development of PET solutions. The lab is a cross-project initiative allowing us to integrate and reuse previously developed PET functionalities to boost the development of new protocols and solutions.

The package `tno.mpc.encryption_schemes.utils` is part of the [TNO Python Toolbox](https://github.com/TNO-PET).

_Limitations in (end-)use: the content of this software package may solely be used for applications that comply with international export control laws._  
_This implementation of cryptographic software has not been audited. Use at your own risk._
